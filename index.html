        <h1 class="page-header">What We Do</h1>
        <p>Besides just being <em>awesome</em>, the technology committee manages all of APSA's technology infrastructure.  Some of the tasks are as simple as email account management while others consist of hosting and maintaining large web applications such as the <a href="https://resdb.physicianscientists.org">Residency Wiki Database</a>.  The main areas of focus include managing the main website, the annual meeting website, and several physician-scientist-focused databases.  Many of these responsibilities involve significant interaction with other committees, including the Public Relations Committee and the Policy Committee.</p>

            <p>This site is the main public face of APSA displayed to the rest of the world.  While the tech committee does not create the majority of the content, we manage the display of information to keep it looking professional in a web environment.  The site uses <a href="https://www.yourmembership.com/">Your Membership</a> as both the content management system and hosting provider; however, it is not without some flair added by the tech committee.</p>

            <h2>Annual Meeting Website</h2>
            <p>APSA keeps everyone up to date for its Annual Meeting through this site.  Rather than using a content management system, the tech committee hand-engineered it with the help of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/">Bootstrap 3</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery 3</a> in order to provide users a fantastic experience!  We chose simple Github hosting through <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> to keep the site running seamlessly throughout the event.  Recently integrated JSON makes managing the schedule much easier with the site now building most of itself from the data.</p>

This <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">mediawiki</a> hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet allows programs to advertise their research-friendly programs while providing students a starting point for making their list of programs to apply to.</p>
